Athomux Public Patent License version 1


                             Preamble

This patent license is intended to ensure compatibility of all my
current and future patent rights with Athomux under the GPL and/or LGPL.

In case of conflict with the GPL or LGPL, the obligations from the
GPL resp. LGPL are intended to take precedence, such that the result
of the conflict resolution remains as close as possible to the
intentions of this license.

               TERMS AND CONDITTIONS FOR USING MY PATENTS

  0. Scope of this License
This patent license refers to any current or future patent owned by
Dr. Thomas Schoebel-Theuer, Europaplatz 4, D-70565 Stuttgart, Germany.

The term GPL refers to the Gnu General Public License version 2 as
published by the Free Software Foundation. The term LGPL refers to
the Gnu Lesser General Public License version 2.1 as published by
the Free Software Foundation. When future versions of these
licenses appear, a new version of this document with modfied
conditions may appear; conditions for GPL version 2 and LGPL
version 2.1 will remain intact in such a case.

This license applies to anyone creating Athomux bricks and to
anyone copying, distributing or modifying such a work under the terms
and conditions of the GPL or LGPL.

Other uses of my patents, such as creating or distributing non-(L)GPL
open source or closed source software (whether related to Athomux or not),
are outside the scope of this license and may require a different
patent license in general. For creation of non-Athomux GPL'ed software,
chances are high to get a similar royalty-free public license from me.

  1. Public royalty-free patent license for anything covered by the (L)GPL
Anyone who copies, distributes or modifies software under the terms and
conditions of the GPL or LGPL which also falls under section 0 of this
document, is granted a royalty-free non-exclusive patent license to do
anything which is required by the GPL or LGPL.

  2. Public grant of license for actions not covered by the (L)GPL
For actions inside the scope of this document, but outside the scope of the
GPL or LGPL (such as executing binary code), or for actions not specifically
regulated by the GPL or LGPL, a public royality-free non-exclusive patent
license is granted to anyone who meets all of the following conditions:

  a) you or somebody closely related to you must not sue me or any
     licensee of any GPL'ed or LGPL'ed software for patent infringement
     or for infringement of any other intellectual property right.
     Doing so will immediately terminate all your rights covered by
     this license and not covered by the GPL or LGPL.

  b) as a licensee of any GPL'ed or LGPL'ed software, you must not violate
     the terms and conditions of that software (even if not related to
     Athomux). As soon as you correct all (inadverted) violations of the GPL
     or LGPL, this condition will reinforce.
     Exeption: when you receive software under dual or multiple licenses,
     dropping the GPL or LGPL while faithfully respecting at least one of
     the remaining licenses does not count as violation of the GPL or LGPL.

Stuttgart, 28 October 2004,

Dr. Thomas Schoebel-Theuer

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some explanations:

For some basic technologies used in the Athomux project,
I have submitted patent applications. Currently it is not yet clear
whether and how far patents will be granted, when they will be granted,
and for which countries they will hold.

Patents are independent from copyright, thus even software released
under (L)GPL can be independently restricted by patents, as far as patent
restrictions don't conflict with the (L)GPL. In practice,
a patent holder cannot restrict the mere distribution of _source_
code (since mere _publication_ of patented principles is not protected
by patents), but he may charge you a fee for _using_ (i.e. actually
executing) it. For example, end users _could_ be charged for _execution_,
since the GPL clearly states the following: "Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
they are outside its scope."

However, charging end users is not my intention.

The patents are primarily intended to apply to COMMERCIAL usage by
closed-source software. As long as you write new bricks, distribute,
modify, compile, execute and sell (L)GPL'ed software based on that,
you will never have to pay a charge for doing so. Starting a new
brick implementation and putting it under (L)GPL does not even
require an explicit permission from me; just include a reference to
this file in the header of your brick. This means, Athomux
as founded by me will always be free (both in terms of freedom and
of royality-freeness) and will remain so.

However, if you write and publish bricks under a non-(L)GPL license,
or if you violate the (L)GPL, or if you start _another_ project
(whether closed source, open source, even under GPL, or not) which
uses technologies patented by me, you may have to obtain a patent
license from me. In any such a case or if in doubt, please
contact me. For GPL'ed usage by other projects, there are _very_
high chances that I will grant a similar free public patent license.
For non-GPL usage, chances are lower for getting a license
free of charge.
