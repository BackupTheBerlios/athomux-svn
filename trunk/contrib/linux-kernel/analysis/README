This is the implementation of a tool
for analyzing the Linux kernel code structures.

IT COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES AND SUPPORT AND IS PROVIDED AS-IS.

The purpose of this tool was to do the analysis of the Linux sources
for my master's thesis which can be downloaded here:
http://www.athomux.net/papers/Diplomarbeit_jens.pdf


The implementation was done mainly in the Makefile
using a pipes-and-filters programming style.

It requires a directory tree containing both
the Linux source code and the compiled object files.

The tool can be used to analyze structures on
symbol, object, module, directory or subsystem level.

Directories can be clustered to subsystems
which are defined in subsys.sed.  Note that this tool
comes with different variants of subsys.sed.

Read and understand the Makefile for details!



For practical application here the most common make targets
which I also used for my thesis:

linux_subsystems.dot / linux_subsystems.ps
	Graph for Chapter 4.2.1.1 (Overview of Subsystems)

dots_sys / linux_subsys
	Graphs for Chapter 4.2.1.2+ (Structure of the Subsystems)

dots
	Graphs for Appendix A (External Dependencies of the Subsystems)

stat_table.txt
	Table for Appendix B (Interface Relevance)
