<h1>Concatenate HTML Files</h1>

</center>

<!---------------- Description ---------------->

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This script combines a number of HTML files into one. The beginning of the
first file (up to and including <var>&lt;body ...&gt;</var>) is used for all
the files since only their bodies are concatenated. An optional divider
followed by the label of a file is used between files.

<p>
Note that:

<ul>

<li>
the original files must conform to HTML conventions; if necessary use
<var><a href="htmlfix.html">htmlfix</a></var> first to correct major problems

<li>
<var>&lt;body ...&gt;</var> and <var>&lt;/body&gt;</var> must be on a line
of their own; any other information on these lines will be lost

<li> in anchors, <var>href="..."</var>  and <var>name="..."</var> must
be not be split across a line

<li> any material after "&lt;/body&gt;" (such as HTML comments) will
be lost

<li>
the script might get confused by a symbolic directory index link or
references to files in remote directories (though it does its best)

<li>
if you move the concatenated HTML file, remember to move any other local
files (e.g. images) to the same relative location (e.g. the same directory)

<li>
for use with a frame-based collection of files, exclude the
<var>frameset</var> definition file from the list of inputs and probably
start with a contents file

</ul>

<!---------------- Options ---------------->

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>
The command line options are:

<dl>

<dt>
<var>-d</var>
<dd>
print divider between concatenated files

<dt>
<var>-h</var>
<dd>
print usage as help

<dt>
<var>-o file</var>
<dd>
name output file (this will be ignored if present in the input list, e.g.
due to giving <var>*.html</var>)

<dt>
<var>-s</var>
<dd>
sort input files into case-insensitive alphabetical order (putting the index
file first if necessary, and removing the file it points to from the inputs
if it is a symbolic link)

</dl>

<!---------------- Usage ---------------->

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
Run on one or more HTML files. Warning messages are sent to standard error.
Examples of usage are:

<dl>

<dt>
<var>htmlcat -o some.html def.html res.html</var>
<dd>
concatenate <var>def.html</var> and <var>res.html</var> to
<var>some.html</var>

<dt>
<var>htmlcat -d -o all.html *.html</var>
<dd>
concatenate all HTML files to <var>all.html</var> with dividers between them

<dt>
<var>htmlcat -o -s out.html *.html</var>
<dd>
sort then concatenate all HTML files to <var>out.html</var>

<dt>
<var>htmlcat *.html &gt; /tmp/all.html</var>
<dd>
concatenate all HTML files to standard output (here
<var>/tmp/all.html</var>); for this method, do not create a concatenated
file in the same directory or the script will run indefinitely on its own
output!

</dl>

<p>
The only things likely to need changed for installation are the directory
index filename and the nature of a file divider (see <var>customise</var>
subroutine in the code). Change the first line of the script according to
where <var>Perl</var> is located. Although tested with <var>Perl5</var>, the
script may work with only minor changes for <var>Perl4</var>.
